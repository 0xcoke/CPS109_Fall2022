Write an employee class. This class will contain three key pieces of data: employee name, employee number
and employee position. Then, write a method which gives them a promotion, that changes their position.

class employee:
    def __init__(self, employee_name, employee_num, employee_pos):
        # Your code goes here
    
    def promotion(self, new_position):
        # Your code goes here.

Then, write a function that checks to see if the name of an employee is the same as a different employee
(so their name is the same but their employee number is different). This will not be a class method, but its
own function. If they're the same name but different employee numbers, change the first employee number to the
second employee number and return it.

def check_employee(emp_one, emp_two):
    # Your code here.
