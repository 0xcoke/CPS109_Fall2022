Will be uploaded at 9:05 a.m. on Thursday September 22nd. This is a timed exercise after all!

Just a couple of reminders from last week:

1. Your Quiz will be assigned in the second half of the lab, and you will have until the end of the lab (~1 hour) to complete and run through it
2. When you are done your Quiz, raise your hand and a TA will get to you. There is a queue system
3. You will be split into groups. Every member of the group is expected to be able to explain any line of the solution

4. Academic Dishonesty: You are allowed to use the official Python documentation. You can refer to any of the Github examples. You ARE NOT allowed to use Google / 
Stack Overflow / etc. for anything past syntax (i.e. no logic). Ask your TA if you have a question.

Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in a list of strings as input. Your goal will be to count the total number of vowels across all strings in a list.
Remember that vowels are: a, e, i, o, u, and SOMETIMES y. For the purpose of this question, we only count y as a vowel if it occurs at the end of a whole string (NOT individual words in a string)!!
You can assume that input strings are all lowercase by default.

Within the function:
Create an integer num_vowels and set it to 0.
Iterate over the list of strings using some kind of loop. Then, iterate over each character (perhaps via index) in each string. If you encounter a vowel (as defined above), add 1 to your num_vowels variable.
Finally, return num_vowels.
Hint: Recall nested loops.

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
First create an empty list.
Then, set some integer num_strings to user input, representing the amount of strings that should be added to the list.
Prompt the user to enter a string num_strings times, and for each string they enter add it to the list.
Finally, print the call of the above function using the (now non-empty) list as input.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 3
>>> apple
>>> banana
>>> clementine
Output:
9

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 2
>>> very cherry
>>> yuzu
Output:
5

# Note: If you count the vowels for input 2 you'll notice it's 1 less than the actual number (6). This is because the word 'very' does not occur at the end of the string as a whole.
# It is much trickier to count if y occurs at the end of each word in a string (consider, we'd have to split the string into individual words). We'll try this in the bonus!

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

You will frequently be tasked with using functions from standard libraries.
This time, you'll use Python's string.replace() method (https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/replace.html) to do the above, 
but instead of just counting vowels, you will first uWu-ify the list strings, then count the number of vowels, and finally return (and print) both the num_vowels AND then new uwu-ified list.
To uWu-ify a string, replace all r's and l's with w's.

We will also modify how we consider y's. Now, instead of occuring at the end of the whole string to be considered a vowel, it should occur at the end of a word within the string.
To split the string into individual words, we can use Python's string.split() method (https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/split.html).
For simplicity's sake, if a "word" has punctuation at the end we will not consider an ending y as a vowel: (e.g. "toy year" has 4 vowels, but "toy! year" has 3 vowels by this definition.)

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 2
>>> clementine
>>> these bonus questions are really really fun!
Output:
21
['cwementine', 'these bonus questions awe weawwy weawwy fun!']

Note: If you count the vowels you'll notice it's now the actual number (21). We'd get 19 in the non-bonus question. This is because for the words 'weawwy' (which occur 2x), we count the y as a vowel.
