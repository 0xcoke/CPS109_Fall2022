Just a couple of reminders from last week:

1. Your Quiz will be assigned in the second half of the lab, and you will have until the end of the lab (~1 hour) to complete and run through it
2. When you are done your Quiz, raise your hand and a TA will get to you. There is a queue system
3. You will be split into groups. Every member of the group is expected to be able to explain any line of the solution

4. Academic Dishonesty: You are allowed to use the official Python documentation. You can refer to any of the Github examples. You ARE NOT allowed to use Google / 
Stack Overflow / etc. for anything past syntax (i.e. no logic). Ask your TA if you have a question.

Quiz Question:

You've recently been hired to be a bouncer at the hippest coffee bar in town. All the stylish coffee-loving strings are to be allowed entry, but you've heard that secret agent strings
from a rival tea bar are trying to sneak in and promote their own business. As a great coder, you've managed to figure out the algorithm behind determining if a given customer/string is a
true coffee fan or a tea double agent. Tea agents love tea and hate coffee - so much so that they will either have more than 3 instances of the letter "t" in their string, or less than 
4 instances of the letter "c" (as they detest coffee so much)!

Write a function that takes in a list of strings as input. Your goal will be to remove any string that contains more than 3 instances of the letter t, or less than 4 instances of the letter c from the list.

Within the function:
Use some kind of loop to iterate over the strings/elements in the list.
You'll want to keep track of how many "t"s and how many "c"s are in each string/element. You can assume that all strings are lowercase.
Using another loop, iterate over the strings in the list themselves, and count the number of "t"s and "c"s in those strings.
If a string has either more than 3 "t"s, or less than 4 "c"s, remove it from the list.
Hint: You don't have to return the original list variable with the offending strings removed (you can return some new list variable). There can be issues if you're trying to edit a list while iterating over it...
Finally, return the updated list.

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
First create an empty list.
Then, set some integer num_strings to user input, representing the amount of strings that should be added to the list.
Prompt the user to enter a string num_strings times, and for each string they enter add it to the list.
Finally, print the call of the above function using the (now non-empty) list as input.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 4
>>> coffee is crazy cool cause caffiene is awesome
>>> tea is totally terrible trash! totally!
>>> cold coffee is chilly (brrr!)
>>> calgary coffee contains ice
Output:
['coffee is crazy cool cause caffiene is awesome', 'calgary coffee contains ice']

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 4
>>> ccc
>>> cccc
>>> ccccttt t
>>> ccccttt
Output:
['cccc', 'ccccttt']

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

You will frequently be tasked with using functions from standard libraries.
This time, you'll use Python's string.replace() method (https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/replace.html) to do the above but also uWu-ify the list strings.
To uWu-ify a string, replace all r's and l's with w's.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 2
>>> i really love coffee cause it tastes like caramel and candy
>>> i can't stand coffee
Output:
['i weawwy wove coffee cause it tastes wike cawamew and candy']

Also, special shout out to those who completed the super duper bonus last week (hopefully I spelled your names right!):
