Will be uploaded at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday September 22nd. This is a timed exercise after all!

Just a couple of reminders from last week:

1. Your Quiz will be assigned in the second half of the lab, and you will have until the end of the lab (~1 hour) to complete and run through it
2. When you are done your Quiz, raise your hand and a TA will get to you. There is a queue system
3. You will be split into groups. Every member of the group is expected to be able to explain any line of the solution

4. Academic Dishonesty: You are allowed to use the official Python documentation. You can refer to any of the Github examples. You ARE NOT allowed to use Google / 
Stack Overflow / etc. for anything past syntax (i.e. no logic). Ask your TA if you have a question.
(https://docs.python.org/3.10/)

Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in a list of strings as input. Your goal will be to print the list items in reverse order, with the strings themselves also being reversed.

Within the function:
Use some kind of loop to iterate over the elements in the list.
Using another loop, print the reverse of the string at that list index, WITHOUT using any built-in string methods.
Hint: Recall that you can use the syntax: curr_str += new_stuff to add the string new_stuff to the existing string curr_str.
Finally, return a list that has both the element order and the element contents reversed (basiclaly a list with the above).

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
First create an empty list.
Then, set some integer num_strings to user input, representing the amount of strings that should be added to the list.
Prompt the user to enter a string num_strings times, and for each string they enter add it to the list.
Finally, print the call of the above function using the (now non-empty) list as input.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 3
>>> apple
>>> banana
>>> clementine
Output:
enitnemelc
ananab
elppa
['enitnemelc', 'ananab', 'elppa']

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 2
>>> racecar
>>> emordnilap
Output:
palindrome
racecar
['palindrome', 'racecar']

# Note: If you count the vowels for input 2 you'll notice it's 1 less than the actual number (6). This is because the word 'very' does not occur at the end of the string as a whole.
# It is much trickier to count if y occurs at the end of each word in a string (consider, we'd have to split the string into individual words). We'll try this in the bonus!

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

You will frequently be tasked with using functions from standard libraries.
This time, you'll use Python's string.replace() method (https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/replace.html) to do the above but also uWu-ify the list strings.
To uWu-ify a string, replace all r's and l's with w's.


Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> How many strings in list: 2
>>> !nohtyp evol I
>>> tsrif emoc dluohs sihT
Output:
This shouwd come fiwst
I wove python!
['This shouwd come fiwst', 'I wove python!']
