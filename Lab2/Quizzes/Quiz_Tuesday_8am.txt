Just a couple of reminders from last week:

1. Your Quiz will be assigned in the second half of the lab, and you will have until the end of the lab (~1 hour) to complete and run through it
2. When you are done your Quiz, raise your hand and a TA will get to you. There is a queue system
3. You will be split into groups. Every member of the group is expected to be able to explain any line of the solution

4. Academic Dishonesty: You are allowed to use the official Python documentation. You can refer to any of the Github examples. You ARE NOT allowed to use Google / Stack Overflow / etc.  for anything past syntax. Ask your TA if you have a question.

Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in a list of strings as input.
Within the function:
For every item of the input list at an even index (0,2,...) print out the string at that index with a question mark at the end. Remember that lists start at index 0.
For every item of the input list at an odd index (1,3,...) print out the string at that index with an exclamation mark at the end.

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
First create an empty list.
Then, set some integer num_strings to user input, representing the amount of strings that should be added to the list.
Prompt the user to enter a string num_strings times, and for each string they enter add it to the list.
Finally, call the above function using the (now non-empty) list.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> 4
>>> What do we want
>>> Sleep
>>> When do we want it
>>> Now
Output:
What do we want?
Sleep!
When do we want it?
Now!

Input:
>>> 2
>>> Why are there two example inputs
>>> So we can test for variable list size
Output:
Why are there two example inputs?
So we can test for variable list size!

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

Again, you will frequently be tasked with using functions from standard libraries.
This time, you'll use Python's string.replace() method (https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/replace.html) to do the above, but instead print an uWu-ified version of the user input strings.
To uWu-ify a string, replace all r's and l's with w's.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> 2
>>> Do you like this bonus question
>>> I really, really love it

Output:
Do you wike this bonus question?
I weawwy, weawwy wove it!
