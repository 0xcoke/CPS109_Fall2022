Write a program which asks the user a series of questions.
What these questions ask is up to you.

Store these answers in a list, then loop backwards through the collection of
answers. These answers should be printed to the screen.

Example:

>>>What is your name?
Cassandra
>>>Where did you go to high school?
Trenton
>>>Why are you at Ryerson?
Good question

>>>Good question
>>>Trenton
>>>Cassandra

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***
Write a program that does the above, but then returns uWu-ified versions of the responses.
To uWu-ify a string, replace all r's and l's with w's.
Hint: Use Python's string.replace() method (https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/replace.html)

Example:

>>> What is your name?
Chris
>>> Where did you do your undergrad?
University of Toronto
>>> Why are you at Ryerson?
To study really interesting problems

>>> To study weawwy intewesting pwobwems
>>> Univewsity of Towonto
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>> Chwis

>>> Chwis
