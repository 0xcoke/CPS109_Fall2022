Write a program which asks the user a series of questions.
What these questions ask is up to you.

Store these answers in a list, then loop backwards through the collection of
answers. These answers should be printed to the screen.

Example:

>>>What is your name?
Cassandra
>>>Where did you go to high school?
Trenton
>>>Why are you at Ryerson?
Good question

>>>Good question
>>>Trenton
>>>Cassandra
