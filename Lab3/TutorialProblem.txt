Write a program that sorts this list of integers:

[2, 6, 1, -1, 55, 12, -100, 0]

Output: [-100, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 55]

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

Sun Baby has kidnapped all the teletubbies and scattered them in the list of integers (for what nefarious purpose? - we can only speculate!)
Your vital mission is to relocate the captured creatures, moving them to a new list called Azkaban (a wonderful facility with a seaside view)
However, the teletubbies are prone to escaping, so you must ensure that in the Azkaban list each teletubby is flanked by a "special friend" called a dementor on each side (represented by the string: "dementor")

And don't forget to sort the original list of integers - lest ye incur the wrath of Sun Baby!

Input: [2, "Tinky Winky", 6, 1, "Dipsy", "Laa-Laa", -1, 55, 12, -100, 0, "Po"]

Output: >>> print(integer_list) # Or whatever your sorted integer list is called
>>> [-100, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 55]

>>> print(Azkaban) # The teletubbies can be in any order, but don't forget the dementors!
>>> ["dementor", "Tinky Winky", "dementor", "Dipsy", "dementor", "Laa-Laa", "dementor", "Po", "dementor"]
