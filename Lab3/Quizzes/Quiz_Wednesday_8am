Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in a list of lowercase strings as input. Your goal will be to return the list with all instances of the letter "e" removed.
Additionally, if any individual string has more than 4 instances of the letter "e" in it, remove that string entirely.

Within the function:
Note: You ARE NOT allowed to use str.replace() here, or any built-in string methods!
Return a list composed of all string elements from your input list with the letter "e" removed. If any string from the input list has more than 4 "e"s in it, do not include it in the return list at all.
Hint: It can cause problems if you're iterating over a list and modifying it at the same time (consider what you might try to access...). Instead, you can create a new list and return that.
Hint 2: Recall that you can use the syntax: curr_str += new_stuff to add the string new_stuff to the existing string curr_str.
Hint 3: Recall nested loops

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
First create an empty list.
Then, set some integer num_strings to user input, representing the amount of strings that should be added to the list.
Prompt the user to enter a string num_strings times, and for each string they enter that is not equal to "sneak", add it to the list.
If they enter "sneak", chide them, and prompt them to enter a different string. The final length of your input list should still be num_strings.
Finally, print the call of the above function using the (now non-empty) list.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
>>> Enter the number of string in your list: 3
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "amongus"
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "fortnite"
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "minecraft"
Output:
['amongus', 'fortnit', 'mincraft']

Input:
>>> Enter the number of string in your list: 4
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "creep"
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "crawl"
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "sneak"
Nice try, but no "sneak"ing in my list!
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "eerie creek"
>>> Enter a string to add to your list: "seething teeth"
Output:
['crp', 'crawl', 'sthing tth']
