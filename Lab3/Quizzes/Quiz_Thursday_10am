Quiz Question: I Need T!

You are a tired CPS109 student. You need your caffiene, but you hate coffee. Therefore you need tea. You need tea so badly, that even the letter "t" will suffice.

Write a function that takes in a list of lowercase strings as inputs.
Your goal will be to return the string in the list that has the most occurances of the letter "t", and print how many "t"s it has.

Within the function:
Iterate over all strings within the list.
Count the number of occurances of the letter "t" within each string.
You are NOT allowed to use any string or list methods.
Print the number of "t"s in the string that has the most "t"s, and return that string.

Outside of the function (in the if __name__ == "__main__" block):
First create an empty list.
Then, set some integer num_strings to user input, representing the amount of strings that should be added to the list.
Prompt the user to enter a string num_strings times, and for each string they enter add it to the list, but only if it does not contain the character "c"! (Remember - you hate coffee!)
If they enter a string that contains the character "c", chide them, and prompt them to enter a different string.
The final length of your input list should still be num_strings.
Finally, print the call of the above function using the (now non-empty) list.

Example Input/Output:

Input: 
>>> Enter the number of strings in your list: 3
>>> Enter a string: tea is tart
>>> Enter a string: steve's tears
>>> Enter a string: i am tired
Output:
3
