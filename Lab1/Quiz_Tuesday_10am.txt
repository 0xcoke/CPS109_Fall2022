Every week during the second hour of labs a quiz will be assigned. We'll be splitting the lab into groups, and you will work with your peers to complete
the quiz requirements during the lab session. Your quiz will take concepts that you've learned in the previous lecture or lab and get you to apply them.

Since students are divided into groups, your TA may ask any member of the group to explain part of the code, so as to ensure that every student understands.
If you're experienced with python, help your peers out, and don't write everything by yourself.

Please raise your hand when your group is done with the quiz, and a TA will come around to assign you a mark. There is no D2L upload required for Quizzes.
There will also be a completely optional bonus component of the quiz. These take the concepts a step further and challenge you.
The bonus is NOT FOR MARKS (so only do it after you have completed the main part).

Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in as input three numbers.
Find the smallest number among them using if statements, and print it.
If any two numbers are equal to eachother, also print "There are equal numbers among us!"

Example Input/Output:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 1

Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 2
Output: 2
        There are equal numbers among us!

Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 2
        There are equal numbers among us!

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

Often times you'll be using functions from standard libraries or those written by other people.
Try using Python's built-in min function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min to reduce the size of your function to 3-4 lines!
Then, print the sum of a, b, and c.

Example Input/Output:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 1
        6
