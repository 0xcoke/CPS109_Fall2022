Every week during the second hour of labs a quiz will be assigned. We'll be splitting the lab into groups, and you will work with your peers to complete
the quiz requirements during the lab session. Your quiz will take concepts that you've learned in the previous lecture or lab and get you to apply them.

Since students are divided into groups, your TA may ask any member of the group to explain part of the code, so as to ensure that every student understands.
If you're experienced with python, help your peers out, and don't write everything by yourself.

Please raise your hand when your group is done with the quiz, and a TA will come around to assign you a mark. There is no D2L upload required for Quizzes.
There will also be a completely optional bonus component of the quiz. These take the concepts a step further and challenge you.
The bonus is NOT FOR MARKS (so only do it after you have completed the main part).

Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in 4 variables: a, b, c, and d, as input. You can assume that these input variables are integers or floats.
Within the function body, use if (and/or elif, else) statements to find both the minimum and maximum values from among these input variables.
Print the minimum value, then print the maximum value, and return the sum of the minimum and maximum values. 
Finally, (now outside the function) when you call the function, set its output to some variable. Then, print that variable.

Example Input/Output:

Input: a = 2, b = 1, c = 4, d = 3
Output: 1
        4
        5

Input: a = 2, -2, 2, 2
Output: -2
        2
        0

Input: a = 3.1, b = 3.01, c = 3.001, d = 3.0001
Output: 3.0001
        3.1
        6.1001
        
*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

Often times you'll be using functions from standard libraries or those written by other people.
Try using Python's built-in max function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max 
and Python's build-in min function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min to reduce the size of your function!

Recall as well that you can format your print statements by combining strings with integers (or even casting integers to strings).
Right now your function output is a bit unintuitive. Update it so that your output (NOT just the print statement - the function output!) has the following format:
"The sum of the minimum and maximum variables is [whatever the sum value is]."

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4
Output: 1
        4
        The sum of the minimum and maximum variables is 5.
        
*** Optional SUPER Bonus Question (NOT for marks) ***

Try to reduce the number of lines in the body of the function to two using the above functions and some clever printing.
You can do this at the cost of efficiency (4 total calls to max/min), BUT you can also do this without being inefficient (2 total calls to max/min)!

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4
Output: 1
        4
        The sum of the minimum and maximum variables is 5.
        
*** Optional SUPER DUPER Bonus Question (NOT for marks - for clout) ***

If we relax the requirement of printing the min/max then returning the sum both within the function, and instead either print within the function
OR return within the function, we can reduce the number of lines in the body of the function to just one!
Then, using a single line we can either call the function (which prints internally) OR print the function output (which just returns).

Again, we can do this at the cost of efficiency (4 total calls to max/min), BUT you can also do this without being inefficient (2 total calls to max/min)!
This means you can write the whole program in just 3 lines - a function definition, a print/return statement in the body of the function, and a function call. 
If you can do this with the optimal efficiency I will think of some prize to give you!

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4
Output: 1
        4
        The sum of the minimum and maximum variables is 5.
