Every week during the second hour of labs a quiz will be assigned. We'll be splitting the lab into groups, and you will work with your peers to complete
the quiz requirements during the lab session. Your quiz will take concepts that you've learned in the previous lecture or lab and get you to apply them.

Since students are divided into groups, your TA may ask any member of the group to explain part of the code, so as to ensure that every student understands.
If you're experienced with python, help your peers out, and don't write everything by yourself.

Please raise your hand when your group is done with the quiz, and a TA will come around to assign you a mark. There is no D2L upload required for Quizzes.
There will also be a completely optional bonus component of the quiz. These take the concepts a step further and challenge you.
The bonus is NOT FOR MARKS (so only do it after you have completed the main part).

Quiz Question:

Write a function that takes in as input two integers and a string.
If the two integers are equal to eachother, print "There is harmony".
If one of the numbers is over two times greater than the other number to the power of two, print "There is discord".
If neither of the above are true, print the input string.

Example Input/Output:

Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = "Hello World"
Output: There is harmony

Input: a = 2, b = 9, c = "Hello World"
Output: There is discord

Input: a = 2, b = 7, c = "Please print me"
Output: Please print me

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

Just like you're able to compare integers using comparators (==, <=, >=, etc.), you can also do the same with strings!
Create a new version of the above function that now takes in two integers and two strings.
Just as before, if the two integers are equal to eachother, print "There is harmony".
Also as before, if one of the numbers is over two trimes greater than the other number to the power of two, print "There is discord".
However, now if neither of the above are true, if the input strings are equivalent, then print "There is string harmony".
Otherwise, print the longest input string. If there is a tie you can print either input string.

Example Input/Output:

Input: a = 2, b = 7, c = "Harmony", d = "Harmony"
Output: There is string harmony.

Input: a = 2, b = 7, c = "I am longer", d = "I am short"
Output: I am longer

Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = "Drums", d = "Drums in the deep"
Output: There is harmony
