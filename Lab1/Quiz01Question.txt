Write a function that takes as inputs the a,b and c coefficients of a quadratic equation
of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and calculates and prints the roots.  
Otherwise, if there are no roots, print 'Has no solution'

Recall: The quadratic formula https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula
Recall: You can check if a quadratic's roots do not exist by checking if the discriminant (the part under the square root sign) is negative.
Recall: You can put strings and floats together by casting using the following syntax: "string1" + str(float1) + "string2" + ...

Example input/outputs:

Input: a = 4, b = 6, c = 2
Output: The roots are -0.5 and -1.0

Input: a = 4, b = 8, c = 4
Output: The root is -1.0

Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 2
Output: Has no solution
