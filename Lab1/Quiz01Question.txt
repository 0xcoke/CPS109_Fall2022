Write a function that takes as inputs the a,b and c coefficients of a quadratic equation
of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and calculates and prints the roots.  
Otherwise, if there are no roots, print 'Has no solution'

Recall: The quadratic formula https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula
Recall: You can check if a quadratic's roots do not exist by checking if the discriminant (the part under the square root sign) is negative.
