# CPS109 Fall 2022
This is where examples for the labs and the quizzes will be posted on a weekly basis.

To see the examples, click the folder for the week you want (lab 1 examples are in the folder Lab1 for instance).
There, you will see things like "Example_One.py". Just click that and it will show you the code in your browser.

Many thanks to the head TA Cassandra Laffan for having created the examples contained within, with some edits from your TA team.
