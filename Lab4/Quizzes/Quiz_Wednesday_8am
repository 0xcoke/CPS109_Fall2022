Quiz Question:

Your goal for this quiz will be to implement a function that, given a list of strings, returns a list composed of lists for each string, containing the letters
of the alphabet that are not present in that string. You can assume the user input is all lowercase.

Recall that the letters of the alphabet are:
["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]

Function 1:

As input to the function, take in some string called: termination_word

Within the function, prompt a user to enter a string. Keep prompting the user for a string until they enter the termination_word string.

Once the user has entered the termination word, create some new outer list, and for each string in your original list add a new inner list composed of all letters
of the alphabet which do not occur in that particular string.
Hint: Recall the "in" keyword
At the end of your function, return that greater list, alongside the original list of strings.

In your main, print the call to your function. Do your print in such a way that it first prints the string that the user entered, then a colon, then the list of all
not-included letters for that string, all on the same line.

Example Input/Output:

Input: 
termination_word = "halt!"
>>> Enter a string: a spectacular quiz question my good ta
>>> Enter a string: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
>>> Enter a string: abcdefgjklmnopqrstuvwxyzz
>>> Enter a string: halt!
Output:
a spectacular quiz question my good ta : ['b', 'f', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'v', 'w', 'x']
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog : []
abcdefgjklmnopqrstuvwxyzz : ['h', 'i']
