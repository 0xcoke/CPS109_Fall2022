Quiz Question:

Your goal for this quiz will be to implement ONE of two different functions, which are to help your pals pick out their outfits for labs.

Function 1:

Within a function, prompt a user to first enter a colour, and then an article of clothing. You can assume their input is lowercase.

Valid colours include: ["yellow", "orange", "red", "purple", "blue", "green"]
Valid articles of clothing include: ["shirt", "pants", "dress", "sweater"]

If the user enters anything other than one of these valid inputs, admonish them and keep asking until they provide a valid input.
Hint: Recall the "in" keyword
For each valid combination, add a string consisting of colour + article of clothing to a list in the following format: "colour article" (e.g. "blue shirt")
If the user ever enters: "stop", then stop asking them for input, and return the existing list.

In your main, print the call to your function.

Example Input/Output:

Input: 
>>> Enter a colour: blue
>>> Enter an article of clothing: pants
>>> Enter a colour: green
>>> Enter an article of clothing: sweater
>>> Enter a colour: magenta
Please enter a valid colour
>>> Enter a colour: purple
>>> Enter an article of clothing: hat
Please enter a valid article of clothing
>>> Enter an article of clothing: dress
>>> Enter a colour: red
>>> Enter an article of clothing: stop
Output:
["blue pants", "green sweater", "purple dress"]

Function 2:

Within a different function, take in as input a list of colourful clothes (in the format of Function 1's output).
Using the following complementary colour wheel: https://www.edrawsoft.com/howto/color-wheel.png you are tasked with determining if there exists a complementary outfit.

So, if there are two DIFFERENT kinds of articles of clothing that have complementary colours (according to the linked wheel (e.g. blue + orange)), then print: "Nice fit"
Otherwise, print: "Zero drip"

Hint: You are allowed to use str.split() (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) here.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
["blue pants", "red dress", "orange sweater"]
Output:
Nice fit

Input:
["green pants", "purple dress", "blue shirt"]
Output:
Zero drip

Input:
["green shirt", "red shirt", "yellow pants"]
Output:
Zero drip
