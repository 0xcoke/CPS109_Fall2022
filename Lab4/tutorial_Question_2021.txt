'''
Write a FUNCTION that takes an ordered list of integers and a number as arguments.
This function should then use binary search to find where it needs to
insert the number.

The main program should loop and keep adding numbers using this function
until the user wants to exit.

Example (assume our initial list is [1, 4, 6, 9]):

>>>What number would you like to insert into the list?
>>>5
[1, 4, 5, 6, 9]
>>>What number would you like to insert into the list?
>>>-1
[-1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9]
>>>What number would you like to insert into the list?
>>>Bye
Goodbye!
