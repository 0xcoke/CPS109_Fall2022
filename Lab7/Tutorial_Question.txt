'''
Write a program that opens a_file.txt that is included in this folder
in the GitHub repo. Read the file, line by line. Create a dictionary 
that stores the first word of the line as a key, and the second word the
value for said key.

Then, in the main block, have the user input a word. Search the dictionary
for that word, and print off its value.

The structure of your file should be in the form of functions and the main 
block. We will not give you a grade until the file is in this format.
