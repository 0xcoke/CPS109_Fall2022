Assume that sentence is a valid string. Write a function
which returns a list of all the words in sentence, where a
word is a tokenseparated by white space. Then for each word,
make it lowercase and remove any character that is not 
alpha-numeric (a-z or 0-9).

For example, 
sentence_splitter('Red@Dragon....ca is great!')
should return ['reddragonca', 'is', 'great']

Then, write five tests for this function. At least ONE should
be an edge case.
