'''
Assume that sentence is a valid string. Write a function
which returns a list of the most frequent words in the sentence,
where words are obtained by sentence.split(). Each word is trimmed
by removing trailing punctuation marks.

For example, 
split_sentence('Hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon')
should return ['the'] since 'the' is the most frequent word.
split_sentence('red; blue!! blue red']
should return ['red', 'blue'], where the items are in any order.

Then, you should write five tests. At least ONE should be an edge
case.
